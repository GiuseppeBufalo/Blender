Thank you for purchasing "Stylized Hair PRO - Hair editing for Blender"!

Overview

Welcome to "Stylized Hair PRO"! This Blender add-on is focused on working with the hair curves system in Blender, but I've also adapted it to be able to work with other curves (bezier, paths) in the more traditional way of stylized hair creation.

Whether you're a seasoned Blender user or just getting started, "Stylized Hair PRO" aims to an easy altertanive to the tedious hair styling process.

It features a lot of tools to create and control hair curves - from their shape, geometry, materials, ornaments, and even animating them with a Hair Dynamics system.
