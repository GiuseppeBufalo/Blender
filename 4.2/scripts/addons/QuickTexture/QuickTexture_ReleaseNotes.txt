QuickTexture 2024 for Blender 4.0
    New Features
        QuickPaintover allows you to paint textures using your favorite image editor
            Set the full Image Editor .EXE file location in the preferences
            QuickPaintover will cover your entire viewport and project onto the surface like a Mesh Decal
            Make sure you collapse everything down to a single layer before saving, and then use the Apply Paintover tool to update the texture
            Create as many QuickPaintover objects needed!
            Don't forget that these are MESH objects, so you can boolean them and do any other mesh operations!
    	UI is automatically updated to display your custom hotkeys
        Mode option to choose between Procedural Box, View, UV or Triplanar from the start for your QuickTextures
        Create TriPlanar layers
        Delete Material tool to remove all QuickTexture related attributes and materials in order to have a clean slate
        Detailed Error Messages when something goes wrong
        Support Custom Keywords in Filenames so you can ensure your textures are loaded properly
        Supports Metal Maps
	Control Emission Contrast
        Multilayer option for QuickTexture creates 3 layers with edge and dirt masks along with some basic color variation from a single click

        Baking
            Supports baking Metal map
            Bake multiple objects (decals) onto one texture
        Remaking Material into a QuickTexture supports materials with node groups and materials that just had a single diffuse texture
        Mouse movement to change settings now supports wrapping around viewport
            Ctrl/Shift/Alt as multipliers to affect changing settings are now standardized
        Vector Displacement node switched to Displacement so it behaves as expected
        MidLevel control added for Displacement Map
        If no objects are selected when creating a QuickTexture, a Photomodeling Plane will be created from the chosen image(s) 
        If no objects are selected when creating a QuickDecal, a Reference Plane will be created from the chosen image(s)
        Shadow Visibility in both Cycles and Eevee is automatically turned off for all Decals, Ref and Photomodeling Objects
        Escape stops all actions
        Undo warning has been added, please Undo carefully and give it time between each Undo or Blender will crash

    Bug Fixes

        Baking V2
            Preview AO / Cavity checkbox (Cycles Only)
                This will assign an AO and Cavity shader to the mesh
                This preview shader is the only QT feature that is not controlled in the viewport. Feel free to add your own noise textures and tweak the shader further
                You can press the bake button at any point while in this preview mode to bake AO and Cavity textures, with the assumption that you will use them as masks further along in the texturing process
            If you click Bake without a path specified, QT will make a new folder for you and save the images there if your Blender file is saved
        Normal Mask now in global space
        New setting for custom mouse speed multiplier for users with vastly different DPI/Monitor sizes
        Shift+T to switch from QT Procedural Mapping to Triplanar Box Mapping
