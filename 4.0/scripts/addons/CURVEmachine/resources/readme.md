Thank you for your purchase of CURVEmachine!


## To provide support, I need

* proof of purchase of CURVEmachine
* if you report an ERROR or PROBLEM:
    - attach a screenshot of the terminal/system console
        - just a screenshot of the error message in Blender **is not enough**
    - attach a screenshot of the terminal/system console right after starting Blender, to verify other addons are not interfering
    * attach a blend file, if it makes sense, keep it under 1MB
    * describe how to reproduce your ERROR/PROBLEM
* system_info.txt from this CURVEmachine/logs folder


## What's a Terminal/Console?

* find out on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+open+console+terminal)


## Do

Please send the above to [curve@machin3.io](mailto:curve@machin3.io?subject=CURVEmachine%20VERSION: Your Problem Summary (replace this))
